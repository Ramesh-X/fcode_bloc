# Fcode Labs Firebase Repository Architecture for BLoC

This package is the Firebase Repository architecture which is used by 
Fcode Labs (PVT) LTD for Flutter mobile application development with
some additional features.

Recommend to use with `BLoC` pattern by @felangel. But can be used 
without implementing `BLoC` pattern.
